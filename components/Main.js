			<h1>Welcome to our academy</h1>
			<p>Magnus Academy began as Silver Knights when a pair of brothers who grew up loving chess wanted to share their enthusiasm with kids. After ten years teaching chess at hundreds of schools, we partnered with Magnus Carlsen, the world chess champion, to grow the game!
			We'd be excited to have your child join our online academy, where kids ages 4-14 from 30+ states and ten countries come to learn, have FUN, and play chess!</p>
